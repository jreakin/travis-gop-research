    - Calculating profit/kickbacks received but not reported to the Texas Ethics or Federal Election Commissions:
      - In order to account for all the money spent, they would have to send more than 50 calls and texts to every voter. 
      - That's almost 1 call or text per-voter every day...for 17 weeks straight. 
      - It is assumed Save Austin Now did not exponentially overspend on 75% of the services they utilized WAB Holdings, LLC for, and instead use the average determined above. 
        - Save Austin Now paid the same average as Senator Cornyn, Congressman Gonzales, and Trump's campaign for 3/4 services. Roughly 5% average. $40,000. 
        - If 20 text messages and 20 phone calls sent to each of the 156,750 voters = $313,500. 
        - Typical profit margin is 15-30%. Of the $343,500 accounted for that range amounts between $51,525 and $103,050. Except Matt Mackowiak told the Statesman his firm has made $134,125. That's closer to 42%. 
        - 40 text messages and 40 phone calls sent to each voter = $627,000. 
        - 50 text messages and 50 phone calls sent to each voters = $783,750. 
        - A kickback of 42% for 50 calls and text per-voter = $329,175.
